Hi there, this blog is all about me and my little stories. Thanks for visiting my blog, please get in touch with me if you had a question or just needing my little help. I would be glad if we could build something cool.

## Machine Learning

- **Classification of Lung Cancer with Hyperparams Tuning**: Detection of lung cancer from the cell images, resulting the classification of the cell, whether normal or cancer using one of the most powerful and incredible Convolutional Neural Networks model, EfficientNet from Google. Also, applying hyperparameter tuning for getting better accuracy.
- **Intelligent Internet of Things - Weather Forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet**: Bring out the concept of Internet of Things to measure current weather and predict weather in the next 3 days by implementation of predictive analysis using ARIMA and Prophet (from Facebook).
- **Digital Image Processing to Determine Weight and Classification of Cow Weight with Deep Learning**: Measuring the performance of two popular image classification model, InceptionV3 and EfficientNet with preset filters Sobel and Canny in order to classify a cow against its weight.
- **Pascal VOC 2007**: Multilabel Image Classification. Applying transfer learning (pretrained deep learning model) to Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. Final project on DIGITALENT Machine Learning training held by KOMINFO @ Telkom University 
- **Predict House Price**: Applying regression model to predict house price based on King Country dataset. Middle test on DIGITALENT Machine Learning training held by KOMINFO @ Telkom University
- **Shopee Code League 2020 - Logistics**: Identify all the orders that are considered late depending on the Service Level Agreements (SLA) with each individual Logistics Provider.

## Robotic

- **Firefighter Robot**: Robot with 6 legs (spider-like) designed to find and put out the fire in a maze. Built with various sensors and controlled by Arduino Microcontroller. 

## Internet of Things

- **Smart Tambak**: Smart Sysem Based on Internet of Things Designed for Aquaculture. Built to help fish farmers in monitoring and controlling their ponds with ability to detect Umbalan (natural disaster which cause billions of fish deaths).
- **Smart Garden**: Smart Sysem Based on Internet of Things Designed for Gardening. Realtime controlling and monitoring plants in garden.
- **i-Mah**: Smart Sysem Based on Internet of Things Designed for Home. Implementation of Smart Home with efficients networking architecture.

## Android
